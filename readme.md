# PyZork (Alpha)!

Hi! This is just a small game written in Python. It was developed as my first Python App.

In this project i could understand a couple things: 

 - How Python works
 - How Python classes works
 - How Python functions works
 - How to extend classes in Python
 - How venv works
 - How indentation works in Python (and i ❤ it)
 - Semicolons are useless (JK)

This project was inspired by Zork I - The Great Underground Empire. It was a brilliant MS-DOS text game released in 1977 and was how i learned some english.
